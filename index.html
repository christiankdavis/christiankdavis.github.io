                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I was born on the West Side of Chicago. I graduated from Southland College Prep Charter High School in 2016 and now attend Stanford University. I am majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Biocomputation.</p>
                <p>I am a first-generation college student and am learning as I go to navigate my way through these spaces that were not designed for people like me. I am immensely grateful for and thankful to all of the people who came before me and made it possible for me to achieve what I have so far. There's a lot left for me to do and I'll never forget where I came from and what it took for me to get here.</p>
                <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                <p>The farther I go into academia, the more acute the disparities in access are between different communities. One of my goals has become to use my education and the privilege I have gained to increase access to education and resources to communities of color.</p>
